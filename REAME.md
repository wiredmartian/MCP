### Model Context Protocol POC

This is a proof of concept for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows for the management of context in large language models (LLMs). The goal is to create a system that can handle multiple contexts, manage memory, and provide a way to interact with LLMs in a more efficient manner.


#### Running the POC

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
    cd model-context-protocol
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3. Start MCP client (which will also start the server):
    ```bash
    yarn client
    ```
