### Model Context Protocol POC

This is a proof of concept for a Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allows for the management of context in large language models (LLMs). The goal is to create a system that can handle multiple contexts, manage memory, and provide a way to interact with LLMs in a more efficient manner.
